1 a function that returns the sum of two numbers
  START
  #Given 2 numbers num1 and num2
  RETURN num1+num2
  END


2 a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
  START
  #Given an Array of strings - "arr"
  SET output = ""
  FOR element in arr
    output CONCAT element
  RETURN output
  END


3 a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element.
  START
  #Given an Array of integers "arr"
  SET output = []
  FOR index in arr
    IF index is odd
      ADD arr at index to output

  RETURN output
  END

4 a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return null
  START
  #Given an string "str" and a character "char"
  SET counter = 0
  SET output = null
  FOR index in string
    IF string[index] is equal to char
      counter++
    IF counter is 3
      output = index
      BREAK
  RETURN output
  END


5 a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes.
  START
  #Given two arrays arr1 and arr2
  SET output = []
  FOR index up to MAX(arr1 LENGTH, arr2 LENGTH)
    output.PUSH(arr1[index])
    output.PUSH(arr2[index])
  RETURN output
  END
