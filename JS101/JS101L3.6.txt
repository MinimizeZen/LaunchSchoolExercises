Q1: No, the first one will work propertly
Note: I think the question would be more interesting if the second example had a , after "prop1: 'hi there'" instead of ";" as that makes it obviously wrong.

Q2: {"first:[1,2]"}

Q3: A: "one is one" "two is two" "three is three"
    B: "one is one" "two is two" "three is three"
    C: "one is two", "two is three", "three is one"

Q4: Not doing this

Q5: function isDotSeparatedIpAddress(inputString) {
    ipParts = inputString.split('.')
    if(ipParts.length()!==4){return false}
    while(ipParts.length>0) {
      if(!isAnIpNumber(ipParts.pop())){
          return false
        }
    }
    retirm true
  }
